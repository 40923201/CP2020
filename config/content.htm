<h2>Unit1 Succeeding in PC Hardware</h2>
<p>PC Hardware is an online course, where the content will be presented in the form of both text and activities.</p>
<p>PC Hardware是一門線上課程，其中的內容以課文和活動的形式呈現。</p>
<p>While you will have more flexibility than in a traditional course, you will also have more responsibility for your own learning. You will need to:</p>
<p>與傳統課程相比，將擁有更多的彈性，你也需要對自己的學習負責。你會需要：</p>
<p>Plan how to work through each unit.<br/>計劃如何了解每個單元。<br/>Determine how to use the various features of the course to help you learn.<br/>確切知道如何使用課程的各種功能來幫助學習。<br/>Decide when you need to seek additional support.<br/>確定何時需要尋找其他幫助。<br/>What You Need to Know About the Course</p>
<p>需要了解課程的內容</p>
<p>This course contains multiple modules. Each module has features designed to support you as an independent learner, including:</p>
<p>本課程包含多個單元。每個單元都具有幫助自己作為獨立學習者的功能，包括：</p>
<p>Learning Objectives: These are descriptions of what you should be able to do at the end of a section. A Learning Objective will allow you to direct your learning efforts and enable you to monitor your progress as you explore the content and engage in the activities.<br/>學習目標：這些是本節末尾應該做的事情的描述。學習的目的將使自己能夠學習指導，並在探索內容和參與活動時駕馭自己的進度。</p>
<p>Explanatory Content: This is the informational “meat” of every chapter. Consisting of short passages of text with information, examples, images, and explanations, this explanatory content contains pieces such as:<br/>解釋性的內容：這是每章包含的“內容 ”。由說明、知識、範例、圖像和說明的簡要段落組成，此說明的內容包含以下：</p>
<p>Walk-throughs: These are videos embedded in exemplify the pages to the concepts you are exploring. They may provide a more detailed explanation of a topic or guide you through the steps of a process.<br/>演練：這些是插入在頁面中的影片，以舉例說明自己正在探索的學說。他們可能會提供有關主題的詳細說明，或指導自己完成流程的各個步驟。</p>
<p>Examples: Designed to illustrate specific applications of the skills and learning objectives that the course supports you to achieve.<br/>範例：說明該課程幫助自己實現的技能和學習目標的特定用途。</p>
<p>Labs: Simulations and lab activities designed to give you an opportunity to interact with various hardware elements.<br/>實驗室：模擬和實驗活動是為自己提供與各種硬體原理進行交流的機會。</p>
<p>Many Students Wonder sidebars: These sidebars serve two purposes: (1) to give a quick review of concepts, such as "highly specialized input devices," that are used in the PC Hardware material and (2) to provide additional material or background information that you may find surprising and interesting but that is not going to be assessed in the Quiz.<br/>許多學生都想了解補充：這些補充有兩個目的：（1）快速回顧觀念，例如PC硬體材料中使用的“極致專業化的輸入設備”，以及（2）提供其他材料或背景資料可能會發現令人驚訝和有趣的東西，但是測驗中不會對此進行評論。</p>
<p>Learning Activities: There are different types of activities interspersed throughout the course. They include:<br/>學習活動：在整個課程中散佈著不同類型的活動。包括：</p>
<p>Learn By Doing activities: Learn By Doing activities follow the short explanations and examples. These activities give you the chance to investigate and practice key ideas. Learn By Doing activities have hints and feedback to guide you if you need it.<br/>邊做邊學的活動：邊做邊學的活動遵循簡短的說明和範例。這些活動使自己有機會研究和實踐關鍵思想。邊做邊學活動有提示和反饋，以在需要時指導。</p>
<p>Did I Get This? activities: Did I Get This? activities are your chance to do a quick "self-check." These activities do not have hints, and often follow a Learn by Doing activity so that you can determine if you understand the key ideas. This will help you make sure you are ready for graded activities.<br/>我明白了嗎？活動：我明白了嗎？活動是您進行快速“自我檢查”的機會。這些活動沒有提示，通常會跟隨“做中學”活動，以便確定自己是否了解關鍵思想。這將幫助確保已準備好進行分級活動。</p>
<p>Quizzes: These are short assignments that are graded. There is a Quiz at the end of each Module. The Quiz will show you and your instructor how well you understand the key concepts. If you read the information and do the activities in each Module, you should be ready for the Quiz.<br/>測驗：這些是評分的短期作業。每個單元的末尾都有一個測驗。測驗將向自己和自己的老師展示自己對關鍵概念的理解程度。如果閱讀了該信息並在每個單元中進行了活動，那麼自己應該已經做好測驗的準備。</p>
<p>Metacognitive Activities: These activities are designed to support your development as an independent learner, encouraging you to reflect on your progress and plan for continuing success. These activities include:<br/>認知活動：這些活動是在支持自己作為獨立學習者的發展，鼓勵反思自己的進步併計劃繼續取得成功。這些活動包括：</p>
<p>My Response activities: These short activities are located at the end of the module; they encourage you to reflect on your progress through the module and estimate how well you believe you've attained the module's learning objectives. These activities also provide a place to share continuing questions and areas of difficulty (if you're using the course in conjunction with an instructor, your questions will be shared with your instructor).<br/>我的響應活動：這些簡短的活動位於單元的末尾；他們鼓勵自己反思本單元的學習進度，並估計認為自己達到本單元學習目標的程度。這些活動還提供了一個分享繼續存在的問題和困難領域的地方（如果自己與講師一起使用本課程，自己的問題將與講師分享）。</p>
<p>Checkpoints: These activities are located across the course after sections of content that can be particularly challenging or require additional practice. These metacognitive checkpointsencourage you to review your progress so far and assess yourself: are you ready to continue, or do you believe you need additional materials, practice, or self-assessment? If you feel that you're not ready to proceed, these checkpoints provide links to additional learning materials.<br/>檢查點：這些活動位於課程的各個部分之後，這些部分可能特別具有挑戰性或需要其他練習。這些元認知檢查點可以鼓勵您回顧迄今為止的進展並進行自我評估：準備好繼續嗎，還是認為需要其他材料，練習或自我評估？如果感覺還沒有準備好繼續，可以使用這些檢查點來鏈接到其他學習資料。</p>
<h2>Uint2 Hardware Basics</h2>
<p>PCH1 Introduction</p>
<p><span>This lesson will cover the basics of PC Hardware. First, you will learn the various parts of both desktop and laptop computers. Next, you will discover basic terms that are associated with computers, such as hardware, software, and firmware. You will learn the most basic functions of a computer: input, output, storage, and processing. Next, you will explore various input and output interfaces on the computer and the associated cables. Finally, you will review connections between common peripherals and discuss the standard ports.</span></p>
<p><span><span>本課將介紹PC硬件的基礎知識。</span><span>首先，將學習台式計算機和便攜式計算機的各個部分。</span><span>接下來，將發現與計算機關聯的基本術語，例如硬件，軟件和固件。</span><span>將學習計算機的最基本功能：輸入，輸出，儲存和處理。</span><span>接下來，將探索計算機上的各種輸入和輸出接口以及相關的電纜。</span><span>最後，將回顧通用外設之間的連接並討論標準端口。</span></span></p>
<p>PCH1 Functions of Computers: Input,Output,Storage,and Processing</p>
<p id="N10690" lang="">What makes a computer a computer? Does a computer have to have certain pieces to be considered a computer? Consider the computers of the 1980s: they all included a display screen, a keyboard, and a processing unit. Over time, the computers have evolved into devices that do not look like a “typical” computer. Consider the iPhone or Android tablet, where the method of input relies on touch, without the use of a separate keyboard. How about the calculator watch displayed below; is it a computer?</p>
<p lang=""><span>是什麼使計算機成為計算機？</span><span>一台計算機是否必須具有某些部件才能視為計算機？</span><span>考慮一下1980年代的計算機：它們都包括顯示屏，鍵盤和處理單元。</span><span>隨著時間的流逝，計算機已經演變為看起來不像“典型”計算機的設備。</span><span>考慮iPhone或Android平板電腦，其中輸入方法依靠觸摸，而不使用單獨的鍵盤。</span><span>下面顯示的計算器手錶怎麼樣？</span><span>是電腦嗎？</span></p>

<p><span>So, as we consider the history of computers and the future of computers, we must consider what is and what is not a computer. Obviously, our desktops and laptops are computers, since they perform the input, processing, output, and storage functions. But so also are our cellular phones and smartphones, since they perform all these functions. What about our televisions? Many of these are complex computers as well, since they take information from our input using the remote control, process the information, and return an output, such as an on-demand movie. Many of these televisions also store the information, such as your favorite channels or even the video content itself for later playback. Even some thermostats are computers, since they also perform these functions, such as the “smart thermostats,” like the NEST and other popular brands. Remember, the main determination of whether something is a computer or not relies on the functions it performs: does it perform input, processing, output, and storage? If so, then it is a computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>因此，當我們考慮計算機的歷史和計算機的未來時，我們必須考慮什麼是計算機，什麼不是計算機。</span><span>顯然，我們的台式機和筆記本電腦是計算機，因為它們執行輸入，處理，輸出和存儲功能。</span><span>但是，由於我們的手機和智能手機執行所有這些功能，所以它們也是如此。</span><span>那我們的電視呢？</span><span>其中許多都是複雜的計算機，因為它們使用遙控器從我們的輸入中獲取信息，處理信息並返回輸出，例如點播電影。</span><span>這些電視中的許多電視也會存儲信息，例如您喜歡的頻道，甚至是視頻內容本身，以供以後播放。</span><span>甚至有些自動調溫器都是計算機，因為它們也執行這些功能，例如“智能自動調溫器，</span><span>像NEST和其他熱門品牌一樣。</span><span>記住，對某物是否是計算機的主要確定取決於它執行的功能：它執行輸入，處理，輸出和存儲嗎？</span></span><span><span>如果是這樣，則它是一台計算機。</span></span></p>
